# Stroman OS — Core Application

Use these prompts one at a time in numeric order. Do not paste an entire volume at once.

# Prompt 026 — Dashboard data contracts

You are continuing the implementation of **Stroman OS**, a professional Creative Intelligence Platform.

## Context

This is sequential build step **26 of 150**, within **Core Application**. The repository may already contain work from all earlier prompts. Treat that work as the current source of truth unless it conflicts with an approved architecture decision.

## Objective

Define dashboard queries, response schemas, and deterministic next-action rules.

## Step-specific engineering direction

Use typed contracts, efficient queries, authorization, predictable errors, and tests.

## Operating rules

- Work only on this prompt's objective. Do not begin the next numbered prompt.
- Read `README.md`, `docs/MVP_SCOPE.md`, `docs/TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the most recent progress log before changing code.
- Inspect existing implementation before creating a second abstraction or duplicate component.
- Preserve strict TypeScript and current architecture boundaries.
- All reads and writes involving workspace data require server-side authorization.
- Do not represent mocked, fixture-based, or undocumented integrations as production-ready.
- Do not create a generic AI chat interface.
- AI content must be visibly distinguishable from human-approved decisions.
- Never invent evidence, external API capabilities, passing tests, or completed work.
- Avoid unrelated refactors. Record discovered out-of-scope problems in `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

## Required process

1. Inspect the relevant code, tests, schemas, migrations, and documentation.
2. State a concise implementation plan before editing.
3. Implement the smallest complete version of this objective.
4. Add or update automated tests that prove the important behavior.
5. Run the narrow tests first, then lint, type-check, and the production build.
6. Fix regressions caused by this step.
7. Update the relevant documentation and `docs/BUILD_PROGRESS.md`.
8. Record any deliberately deferred work with rationale.

## Acceptance criteria

- The objective is usable end-to-end within its intended narrow scope.
- Data access is workspace-scoped and authorized on the server.
- Inputs are validated and failures produce useful, non-sensitive errors.
- Loading, empty, success, denied, and failure states exist where a user interface is involved.
- New schemas and public contracts are typed and documented.
- Existing completed workflows continue to pass their tests.
- There are no knowingly fake success states, hidden TODO behavior, or undocumented shortcuts.
- Documentation explains setup, behavior, limitations, and any operational concerns introduced by this step.

## Tests required

At minimum, add the most appropriate tests from this set:

- Unit tests for isolated rules and validation.
- Database integration tests for persistence and workspace isolation.
- Contract tests for adapters or providers.
- End-to-end tests for user-visible workflows.
- Accessibility checks for new interactive interfaces.
- Regression fixtures for AI behavior when this prompt changes AI logic.

Do not claim a check passed unless you actually ran it. If the environment prevents a check, state the exact command, failure, and remaining risk.

## Documentation updates

Update all directly affected documents. At minimum append to `docs/BUILD_PROGRESS.md`:

- Prompt number and title
- Files changed
- Decisions made
- Tests executed and results
- Known limitations
- Recommended next prompt

## Stop condition

Stop after this objective is implemented, tested, documented, and summarized. Do not start Prompt 027.

# Prompt 036 — Asset library views

You are continuing the implementation of **Stroman OS**, a professional Creative Intelligence Platform.

## Context

This is sequential build step **36 of 150**, within **Core Application**. The repository may already contain work from all earlier prompts. Treat that work as the current source of truth unless it conflicts with an approved architecture decision.

## Objective

Build asset table, grid, filters, status, metadata, and detail drawer.

## Step-specific engineering direction

Implement the complete narrow workflow, not an attractive shell. Include validation, permissions, history, and failure states.

## Operating rules

- Work only on this prompt's objective. Do not begin the next numbered prompt.
- Read `README.md`, `docs/MVP_SCOPE.md`, `docs/TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the most recent progress log before changing code.
- Inspect existing implementation before creating a second abstraction or duplicate component.
- Preserve strict TypeScript and current architecture boundaries.
- All reads and writes involving workspace data require server-side authorization.
- Do not represent mocked, fixture-based, or undocumented integrations as production-ready.
- Do not create a generic AI chat interface.
- AI content must be visibly distinguishable from human-approved decisions.
- Never invent evidence, external API capabilities, passing tests, or completed work.
- Avoid unrelated refactors. Record discovered out-of-scope problems in `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

## Required process

1. Inspect the relevant code, tests, schemas, migrations, and documentation.
2. State a concise implementation plan before editing.
3. Implement the smallest complete version of this objective.
4. Add or update automated tests that prove the important behavior.
5. Run the narrow tests first, then lint, type-check, and the production build.
6. Fix regressions caused by this step.
7. Update the relevant documentation and `docs/BUILD_PROGRESS.md`.
8. Record any deliberately deferred work with rationale.

## Acceptance criteria

- The objective is usable end-to-end within its intended narrow scope.
- Data access is workspace-scoped and authorized on the server.
- Inputs are validated and failures produce useful, non-sensitive errors.
- Loading, empty, success, denied, and failure states exist where a user interface is involved.
- New schemas and public contracts are typed and documented.
- Existing completed workflows continue to pass their tests.
- There are no knowingly fake success states, hidden TODO behavior, or undocumented shortcuts.
- Documentation explains setup, behavior, limitations, and any operational concerns introduced by this step.

## Tests required

At minimum, add the most appropriate tests from this set:

- Unit tests for isolated rules and validation.
- Database integration tests for persistence and workspace isolation.
- Contract tests for adapters or providers.
- End-to-end tests for user-visible workflows.
- Accessibility checks for new interactive interfaces.
- Regression fixtures for AI behavior when this prompt changes AI logic.

Do not claim a check passed unless you actually ran it. If the environment prevents a check, state the exact command, failure, and remaining risk.

- New schemas and public contracts are typed and documented.
- Existing completed workflows continue to pass their tests.
- There are no knowingly fake success states, hidden TODO behavior, or undocumented shortcuts.
- Documentation explains setup, behavior, limitations, and any operational concerns introduced by this step.

## Tests required

At minimum, add the most appropriate tests from this set:

- Unit tests for isolated rules and validation.
- Database integration tests for persistence and workspace isolation.
- Contract tests for adapters or providers.
- End-to-end tests for user-visible workflows.
- Accessibility checks for new interactive interfaces.
- Regression fixtures for AI behavior when this prompt changes AI logic.

Do not claim a check passed unless you actually ran it. If the environment prevents a check, state the exact command, failure, and remaining risk.

## Documentation updates

Update all directly affected documents. At minimum append to `docs/BUILD_PROGRESS.md`:

- Prompt number and title
- Files changed
- Decisions made
- Tests executed and results
- Known limitations
- Recommended next prompt

## Stop condition

Stop after this objective is implemented, tested, documented, and summarized. Do not start Prompt 046.

# Prompt 046 — Character assignment tools

You are continuing the implementation of **Stroman OS**, a professional Creative Intelligence Platform.

## Context

This is sequential build step **46 of 150**, within **Core Application**. The repository may already contain work from all earlier prompts. Treat that work as the current source of truth unless it conflicts with an approved architecture decision.

## Objective

Allow manual speaker-to-character linking, merge, split, and correction.

## Step-specific engineering direction

Implement the complete narrow workflow, not an attractive shell. Include validation, permissions, history, and failure states.

## Operating rules

- Work only on this prompt's objective. Do not begin the next numbered prompt.
- Read `README.md`, `docs/MVP_SCOPE.md`, `docs/TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the most recent progress log before changing code.
- Inspect existing implementation before creating a second abstraction or duplicate component.
- Preserve strict TypeScript and current architecture boundaries.
- All reads and writes involving workspace data require server-side authorization.
- Do not represent mocked, fixture-based, or undocumented integrations as production-ready.
- Do not create a generic AI chat interface.
- AI content must be visibly distinguishable from human-approved decisions.
- Never invent evidence, external API capabilities, passing tests, or completed work.
- Avoid unrelated refactors. Record discovered out-of-scope problems in `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

## Required process

1. Inspect the relevant code, tests, schemas, migrations, and documentation.
2. State a concise implementation plan before editing.
3. Implement the smallest complete version of this objective.
4. Add or update automated tests that prove the important behavior.
5. Run the narrow tests first, then lint, type-check, and the production build.
6. Fix regressions caused by this step.
7. Update the relevant documentation and `docs/BUILD_PROGRESS.md`.
8. Record any deliberately deferred work with rationale.

## Acceptance criteria

- The objective is usable end-to-end within its intended narrow scope.
- Data access is workspace-scoped and authorized on the server.
- Inputs are validated and failures produce useful, non-sensitive errors.
- Loading, empty, success, denied, and failure states exist where a user interface is involved.
- New schemas and public contracts are typed and documented.
- Existing completed workflows continue to pass their tests.
- There are no knowingly fake success states, hidden TODO behavior, or undocumented shortcuts.
